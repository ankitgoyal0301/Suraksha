          <div class="collapsible-body jaskaran">
              <p>According to the International Research Centre for Women, almost 47 percent of girls are married before the age
                of 18. Currently, India ranks 13 in the world when it comes to child marriages. Since child marriage has been
                steeped into the Indian culture and tradition since centuries, it has been tough eliminating it. The Prohibition
                of Child Marriage Act was made effective in 2007. This act defines child marriage as a marriage where the groom
                or the bride are underage, that is, the bride is under 18 years of age or the boy is younger than 21 years.
                Parents trying to marry underage girls are subject to action

              <p>The objectives of this act is to provide â€“ a special form of marriage in certain cases, provide for
                registration of certain marriages and, to provide for divorce. In a country like India and with the diverse
                religions and cast, when people from different faiths and caste chose to get married they do it under the
                Special Marriage Act. It is not applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir and also extends to intending
                spouses who are Indian nationals and living abroad.

          <div class="collapsible-body">
              <p>According to this act, taking or giving of dowry at the time of the marriage to the bride or the bridegroom and
                their family is to be penalised. Dowry system, giving and taking of dowry, is a norm in India. Dowry is often
                asked of the bride and her family by the groom and his family. The system has taken strong roots because women
                after marriage move in with their spouse and in-laws. Also, over the centuries, the lack for economic
                independence of women and the taboo towards divorce has resulted in bride burning. When demands for dowry even
                after marriage are not met by the girl&#39s families, many women are tortured, beaten and even burnt. It is one
                of the major challenges that our society is grappling with. Women openly complaining about it has helped to
                spread the word and encourage other women to take a stand.
